### Step one: Building the Docker image

Build the Docker container image using the following command:

```bash
./mwaa-local-env build-image
```

**Note**: it takes several minutes to build the Docker image locally.

### Step two: Running Apache Airflow

#### Local runner

Runs a local Apache Airflow environment that is a close representation of MWAA by configuration.

```bash
./mwaa-local-env start
```

To stop the local environment, Ctrl+C on the terminal and wait till the local runner and the postgres containers are stopped.

### Step three: Accessing the Airflow UI

By default, the `bootstrap.sh` script creates a username and password for your local Airflow environment.

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `test`

#### Airflow UI

- Open the Apache Airlfow UI: <http://localhost:8080/>.
























# About aws-mwaa-local-runner

This repository provides a command line interface (CLI) utility that replicates an Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) environment locally.

*Please note: MWAA/AWS/DAG/Plugin issues should be raised through AWS Support or the Airflow Slack #airflow-aws channel.  Issues here should be focused on this local-runner repository.*


## About the CLI

The CLI builds a Docker container image locally thatâ€™s similar to a MWAA production image. This allows you to run a local Apache Airflow environment to develop and test DAGs, custom plugins, and dependencies before deploying to MWAA.
